# Work on Quantlib C++ Library

This project was developed for an IMT Atlantique project.  

We are four contributors to this project :  

* NANTAS Paul
* POUPARD Paul
* UNG Théophile
* SPRIET Thibault

## What is the project ❓  

During my second year as an engineer student at IMT Atlantique I followed a "finance program". In this program there was a special course on [Quantlib](https://www.quantlib.org) (free/open-source library for quantitative finance). This course was given by Mr. Luigi Ballabio the creator and main contributor of Quantlib.  

This repo is the final project of the course which was **"Use constant parameters in Monte Carlo engines"**. More precisely, we had to modify a certain part of the Quantlib source code.
